# US Aviation Disruption API 

Data-driven REST API for US flight delay analytics, built on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data for 
2023-2024.

Live API: https://web-services-api.onrender.com
Swagger Docs: https://web-services-api.onrender.com/docs
Live Dashboard: https://webservicesapi-dashboard.streamlit.app

## Overview
 
The Aviation Disruption API transforms ~1 million BTS flight records into actionable analytics. It provides standard 
delay/cancellation metrics alongside a novel graph-based network analysis layer that models the US airport system as a 
directed graph, enabling delay propagation simulation and network influence scoring.
### Key Features
 
- **18+ REST endpoints** across analytics, graph analysis, and CRUD
- **Disruption scoring** — composite 0–100 score per airport/year
- **Route risk analysis** — compare up to 10 routes by historical reliability
- **Graph contagion scores** — NetworkX-based centrality scoring for network influence
- **Ripple effect simulation** — propagate a seed delay through an aircraft's daily schedule
- **Delay cause breakdown** — split delay minutes by carrier/weather/NAS/security/late aircraft
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** connected to the live API

## Authentication

Write endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE) require an `X-API-Key` header. Read and analytics endpoints are public.

```bash
# Authenticated request
curl -X POST https://web-services-api.onrender.com/api/v1/flights/ \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}'

# Public request — no key needed
curl https://web-services-api.onrender.com/api/v1/analytics/disruption-score/JFK
```

API keys are managed via `/api/v1/keys` (requires an existing valid key). To generate the first admin key run 
`python scripts/create_admin_key.py` after deployment. If this does not work run 
`PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/create_admin_key.py` after deployment.


## Project Structure 
```
```

## Local Setup 

# *Prerequisites*

- Python 3.12+
- pip 

## 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jenellebankas/web_services_api.git
cd web_services_api
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Install dependencies 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Seed the database
```bash
python scripts/balanced_dataset.py
```

- must note that using balanced_dataset.py ensures a stratified dataset if seed_db.py used, data is just split by 
- number.

## 5. Run the API
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at: http://localhost:8000
Interactive docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

If you want to run the dashboard 
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Running Tests 

```bash
pytest
```

The expected output is 70 passed.

For verbose output:
```bash
pytest -v
```
for API tests only:
```bash
pytest tests/test_api/
```
For Service tests only:

```bash
pytest tests/test_services/
```
